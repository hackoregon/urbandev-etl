# JSON data

Files named with a sequence of digits contain data obtained from Zillow and the U.S. Census, where the file name is the Zillow region number, which corresponds roughly to Portland "neighborhoods".

The 'queries' folder holds SQL select-statements used to derive the aggregate demographic data that appears in the JSON data files.

MasterApartmentData.json holds apartment listings obtained from [craigslist.org](https://portland.craigslist.org/) for Portland, Oregon from January - May 2016.
