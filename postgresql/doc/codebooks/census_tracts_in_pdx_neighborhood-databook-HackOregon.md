## <a name="datasource">1. Data Source</a>
This data was generated by the Urban Development project. A Python program compared shape files for Portland neighborhoods with shape files for U.S. Census Tracts used for the 2010 Decennial Census. The program calculated the percentage of the Tract area that overlapped the Portland neighborhood area. That amount of overlap is used when trying to correlate census data with a Portland neighborhood.

## <a name="fields">2. Field Definitions</a>
NEIGHBORHOOD_ID integer : foreign key to a Portland Neighborhood.

TRACT_ID varchar : foreign key to a Tract entity. This property is used in census data tables obtained from NHGIS.org

TRACT_YEAR integer : year that this Tract was defined by the Census Bureau.

PERCENT_INSIDE numeric(7,3) : percentage of the Tract that lies within the Neighborhood.

DATA_SOURCE_ID integer : Foreign key to data_source

DATE_LOADED timestamp WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() : when this row was loaded

PRIMARY KEY (NEIGHBORHOOD_ID, TRACT_ID, TRACT_YEAR)

We used [pgloader](http://pgloader.io/) to load the CSV file into a PostgreSQL database. The scripts, data, and instructions are located here: [https://github.com/hackoregon/urbandev-etl/tree/master/postgresql/scripts/data-loaders](https://github.com/hackoregon/urbandev-etl/tree/master/postgresql/scripts/data-loaders)
