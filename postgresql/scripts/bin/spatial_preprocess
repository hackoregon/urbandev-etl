# This script will perform some initial spatial processing required
# to generate database dumps for the `build_db` script
#
# Usage: (You must have a database already created)
#   ./spatial_preprocess <database name>
#
#   This will generate 3 `CREATE-TABLE-INSERT*` scripts in the
#   postgresql/scripts/sql directory
#
# Procedure:
#   1. Load required shapefiles into postgis reprojecting into NAD 83 Oregon North
#       + NHGIS block groups from multiple years (1990, 2000, 2009, 2010, 2014)
#       + Zillow neighborhood boundaries
#       + Open Spaces and Streams sourced from RLIS
#   2. Process Zillow neighborhoods
#       + remove cities outside of Portland Metro
#       + add geometry column that has open spaces and streams removed
#   3. Process Block Groups
#       + merge individual year tables into single table with year as field
#       + remove block groups not intersecting with any Zillow neighborhoods
#       + add geometry column that has open spaces and streams removed
#   4. Compute Zillow Block Group intersection percentage
#       + (area of blkgrp and nbo intersection) / (area of blkgrp)
#       + used to map census/acs data to Zillow neighborhoods
#   5. Export tables as SQL dump files
#       + blkgrps
#       + zillow_neighborhoods
#       + zillow_blkgrps
